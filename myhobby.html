            <h2>‚Äß‚ÇäÀö.My Hobby>>> Cafe Hopping üçµ‚Äß‚ÇäÀö</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite hobbies is Cafe Hopping. I started it when I was 19 , and it has been a big part of my life ever since. The reason why i love do cafe hopping so much it because of it offers a unique blend of exploration, aesthetic pleasure, social connection, personal time, culinary adventure, cultural experience, and relaxation. Each cafe presents a new ambiance, menu, and vibe, making the discovery of new places and trying different food and drinks exciting. The thoughtfully designed interiors, from cozy and rustic to modern and chic, provide visual satisfaction and inspiration. Cafes are ideal for socializing, whether meeting friends, having conversations, or simply people-watching, while also being perfect for personal time, allowing you to read, work, or enjoy some quiet moments. The culinary creativity in cafes, from artisanal coffees to delectable pastries, adds to the thrill of tasting new and unique items. Additionally, cafes often reflect the local culture and community, offering a way to immerse yourself in diverse cultural experiences. The cozy and comfortable environment, with ambient music, comfortable seating, and the aroma of coffee, creates a perfect setting to relax and unwind, making cafe hopping a delightful and enriching experience.</p>

                 <p> One of my best cafe i have been to is Bricks and Bread in Kuala Lumpur is a charming cafe located on Jalan Kamunting in Chow Kit. Known for its Instagrammable whitewashed aesthetics and inviting ambiance, it has quickly become a popular spot since opening. The cafe offers a diverse menu featuring Central American and Mediterranean-inspired dishes, ensuring there's something for every palate.

Signature dishes include the roasted chicken sandwich served with focaccia bread and aji verde sauce, and the seafood laksa spaghettini, which blends traditional laksa flavors with angel hair pasta. For brunch enthusiasts, their shakshouka with feta and mackerel, as well as the hearty Big Breakfast, are must-tries. Desserts like the buttermilk pancake and ranger cookies are also highly recommended.

With friendly service and a cozy atmosphere, Bricks and Bread is a delightful place for a casual meal or a leisurely brunch, open from Tuesday to Sunday, 8 am to 6 pm (kitchen closes at 5 pm)‚Äã.</p>

                <img src="image/photo28.jpg" alt="Photo 4">
                <p>Fly me to KL is located at rooftop of Regalia Residence. It's a Morrocan-inspired cafe and very instagrammable with that will make you feel like you are on a beach vacation with their interior design of the cactus, wooden chairs and umbrellas.

They do have the limit of dining time which is 2 hours, and when do u do the reservation online they will request RM 20 deposit but later will deduct back from your bill later. 

I have reviewed the blogspot before I heading to the cafe that there is min spending of RM 300 if request the outdoor seat with the KL skyline view, however when we reached there at Sunday 12pm they are allow us to have the outdoor seat without any min spending. 

Their food and drinks choices is not much , and the food is average and the price is slightly expensive.</p>

                <img src="image/photo9.jpg" alt="Photo 4">
                <p>Other than finding best cafe, i enjoyed every dessert that they served in their own cafe. As you can see, i love matcha latte. So wherever i go i will always go for matcha latte and some dessert like a tiramisu cake, cheeseburn cake, danish roll and rose lyche cake!. Having sweets after the my meal is of on my way to comfort myself.</p>
