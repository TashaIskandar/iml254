            <h2>My Hometown- ˖°𓇼🌊⋆Sebatik Island, Tawau˖🐚⋆.ೃ࿔*:･</h2>
            <p>I'm fortunate to have grown up on the beautiful island of Pulau Sebatik, which straddles the border between Malaysia and Indonesia. My hometown on the Malaysian side of the island is a small, tight-knit community nestled amidst the lush, tropical forests and pristine beaches that Pulau Sebatik is known for. As a child, I spent countless hours exploring the mangrove estuaries and swimming in the crystal clear waters that surround our island. The sound of waves lapping against the shore and the calls of exotic birds were the soundtrack to my days. My neighbors were always willing to lend a helping hand, and we would often gather for community festivals that celebrated our diverse cultural heritage. While Pulau Sebatik may be remote, it has an undeniable charm and natural beauty that I've carried with me throughout my life. Whenever I return home, I'm reminded of how fortunate I am to have been raised in such a unique and treasured place.</p>

            <center><h3>🌊☆°‧More About My Hometown°‧★🐚</h3></center>
            <p>These are my friends who live there. They have been my friends since I was a kid around 5-7 years old. Their names are Sofia and Intan. We are very close until now but it's hard to meet them often since I live in KL and go back to my hometown once a year during Hari Raya Aidilfitri. Seeing my childhood friends is one of the best parts of going back because we get to catch up after a long time living apart and spend our time together every day.</p>

                <p>I am so happy to be born here because I love my hometown so much. Telling people that I am from Sabah is one of the things that I can proudly share. I just hope that one day I can move and live in my hometown again and get closer to my lovely grandparents as well as my friends and other family relatives.</p>
